<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I don't like any of the calorie trackers I've used so far. Nothing against MyFitnessPal or the like; I just have somewhat different goals. I prefer a more holistic, health-focused approach to fitness and calorie tracking, and I wanted to build a fun dashboard that is nice to look at and feels good to interact with. So I wanted to build an IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros) tracker that is satisfying to use, not focused exclusively on losing weight, and also tracks water and vegetable intake.

For now the app makes no suggestions. I may add a macro/calorie calculator in the future.

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
* User registration
* User dashboard
    * View that shows various values
    * View that shows graphs over time (stretch goal)
* React dashboard with pretty graphs/graphics
* Nutritional information for food (stretch goal)




### Built With
